Mouse listener with canvas demo

This demo logs to console the coordinates of where the mouse clicks and the mouse listener changes the displayed square that is in red to green once the mouse is clicked.

Other mouse events are also implemented such as: mousePressed, mouseReleased, mouseEntered and mouseExited.

This is made in java using Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and Swing
